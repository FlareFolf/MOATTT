                <p>
                The regular good guys. try and find the traitors and any other evil roles lurking around. your goal is to kill all the bad roles and leave only innocents and neutrals standing.

                <h4 align ="center" class="evenrole">Spectre</h4>
                <p>
                The spectre is an innocent role that posesses the person that kills them. the person that kills them will emit black smoke for as long as they live afterwards so everybody will know what they did. once they are killed, the spectre will respawn where their body is. if their body was destroyed, they will respawn on map spawn
            </p>
            </div>

                <h4 align ="center" class="oddrole">Survivalist</h4>
                <p>
                The survivalist is an innocent with a buy menu. you have the same goal as the innocents, but you just get some extra toys to help out with. be careful though as you may be mistaken for a traitor!
            </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <img alt="Wrath" class="roleimg" align="right" src="https://i.imgur.com/imk3bOJ.png">

                <p>  
                The wrath is a regular innocent and unaware that they are the wrath. The wrath turns into a traitor if they are killed by another innocent which is the only time anybody finds out they were the wrath. 
            </p>
            </div>
            <div>

They can also see the amount of dead players which is updated every 30 seconds.
            </p>
            </div>
            <h2>detective roles</h2>
            <div>
                <img alt="Detective" class="roleimg" align="right" src="https://i.imgur.com/50B0iCw.png">
                <h4 align ="center" class="evenrole">Detective</h4>
                <p>  
                The detective is a leading role. They have a buy menu and the means to find out who killed a given dead body using their DNA scanner. it is very important to protect the detective if you're innocent, but if you're a traitor, they should be your first target as they can be a signifficant thorn in your side.
            </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <img alt="Sherrif" class="roleimg" align="left" src="https://i.imgur.com/5ZMPdNu.png">
                <h4 align ="center" class="oddrole">Sherrif</h4>
                <p>  
                The sherrif is a special kind of detective. they also have a buy menu and a DNA scanner and are visible to everybody, but they also have a deputy deagle which they can use to appoint a colleage. whoever they shoot with this will immediately become their deputy regardless of their team. if the sherrif is to die, the deputy will also die.
            </p>

                <h4 align ="center" class="evenrole">Deputy</h4>
                <p>
                The deputy is a role that does not spawn on its own but that merely serves as a colleague to the sherrif. they are a confirmed innocent because they were personally appointed by the sherrif. if the sherrif dies, they die too.
            </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <img alt="Link" class="roleimg" align="left" src="https://i.imgur.com/63rBq93.png">
                <h4 align ="center" class="oddrole">Link</h4>
                <p>  
                Link is a regular detective with more health, armor and a master sword. they play the legend of zelda theme when they spawn in and look like link. nothing special otherwise

            </div>
            <h2><br/>Traitor roles</h2>
            <div>
                <img alt="Traitor" align ="right" class="roleimg" src="https://i.imgur.com/ix3XMde.png">
                <h4 align ="center" class="evenrole">Traitor</h4>
                <p>
                The traitors are the bad guys. their goal is to be the last one standing with their teammates. they have a buy menu which contains lots of items to complete their mission. Try and covertly kill everyone without being found out. 
            </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <img alt="Mesmerist" class="roleimg" align="left" src="https://i.imgur.com/l69Bc8g.png">
                <h4 align ="center" class="oddrole">Mesmerist</h4>
                <p>  
                The mesmerist is a traitor without a buy menu, but with a defibrilator. They have the ability to revive a fallen player as a new part of their team. This person will spawn as a thrall regardless of their previous role. Be careful though as the defibrilator will make noise and alert other players to your actions
            </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <img alt="Thrall" align ="right" class="roleimg" src="https://i.imgur.com/wXP3Omh.png">
                <h4 align ="center" class="evenrole">Thrall</h4>
                <p>
                The thrall is a traitor role. the only way the thrall can spawn is if they are a fallen player that's revived by a mesmerist. in every other way, they are a regular traitor.
            </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <img alt="Arsonist" class="roleimg" align="left" src="https://i.imgur.com/D5nOByC.png">
                <h4 align ="center" class="oddrole">Arsonist</h4>
                <p>  
                The arsonist is a traitor role that spawns with a flamethrower and a flare gun. The flamethrower may be powerful, but the ammo is limited and cannot be replenished.
            </p>
            </div>
            <h2><br/>Jester roles</h2>
            <div>
                <img alt="Jester" align ="right" class="roleimg" src="https://i.imgur.com/kWhmA1y.png">
                <h4 align ="center" class="evenrole">Jester</h4>
                <p>
                The jester is a role that cannot do damage to anybody. they have to fool others into thinking they are evil to get killed. When the jester is killed, they win the round.
            </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <img alt="Swapper" class="roleimg" align="left" src="https://i.imgur.com/Umpd4pf.png">
                <h4 align ="center" class="oddrole">Swapper</h4>
                <p>  
                The swapper is very similar to the jester. they also cannot do any damage and they also need to try and get others to kill them. When the swapper is killed, they swap roles with the person that killed them. The person that killed them will now be the swapper and have to continue what the swapper was doing.
            </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <img alt="Beggar" align ="right" class="roleimg" src="https://i.imgur.com/VY5nao2.png">
                <h4 align ="center" class="evenrole">Beggar</h4>
                <p>
                The beggar is a role that cannot do damage to anybody. Their goal is to try and get an item from the buy of another special role that has it. this can be any role with a buy menu. When they receive an item from somebody's buy menu, they will join the team of that person.
            </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <img alt="Clown" class="roleimg" align="left" src="https://i.imgur.com/FJ4pO3M.png">
                <h4 align ="center" class="oddrole">Clown</h4>
                <p>  
                The clown is a jester type role. they cannot do any damage to anybody and must try to survive until only one team remains. when this is the case, the clown will become enraged and will have to kill the rest of the players and be the last one standing to win
            </p>
